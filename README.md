# Yaku & Scoring cheat sheets

Here is one made by WRC[^3]: https://www.worldriichi.org/player-materials (note that it may differ slightly from the EMA ruleset)

Page 31 of the EMA[^1] rules (linked below) can also be used as a cheat sheet.

# Rules

Riichi Competition Rules used in EMA[^1] tournaments: http://mahjong-europe.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30&Itemid=166

# Games

## Kemono Mahjong (< 4€)

Website: http://cyberdog.ca/kemono-mahjong/

A mobile/Steam game that lets you play against computer with no time limits. It defaults to the EMA rules and provides several tutorials explaining the rules.

(Note that the layout on phone-sized screens is a bit unusual due to space constraints.)

## Tenhou (free)

Website: https://tenhou.net/

"Documentation" (in English): https://arcturus.su/tenhou/

A popular server where you can play for free with players around the world, even without creating an account. The default time limit is 5s per turn + 10s per hand. The website is in Japanese, but the apps and the online client have interfaces in English and several other languages.

# Watch

## USPML[^2] streams (English)

YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@uspml

Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/uspml

Two experienced English-speaking players discussing mahjong and mahjong-related news.

## Abema TV (Japanese)

Website: https://abema.tv/now-on-air/mahjong

Games with live commentary and other mahjong-related content. It's generally free to watch live, although not all content may be available outside of Japan (in that case, you'll see `お住いの地方では　ご視聴できません`). A (paid) subscription is generally required to watch past content on demand.

Note: if you see `ただいまCM中です`, this means that there is an ad break at the moment, but no ads are shown outside of Japan.
