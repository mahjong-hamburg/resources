# Buying a set and a mat

One of the main brands of mahjong tiles in Japan is AMOS (アモス), produced by Taiyo Chemicals (大洋技研株式会社). They currently offer four different sets, two different mats, and a set-and-mat combo. You can see the contents of each set in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUwu27IoCJM .

If I'm not mistaken, the last World Riichi Championship used Junk Mats and the Amos Masters sets (the same ones I bring to the meetups).

## Sets

### Tiles

The tiles in Japanese sets are usually 26mm or 28mm tall, and the tiles used in automated tables are 28mm or 30mm tall.

You may find sets that have a black background instead of white. These are non-standard and require getting used to, so generally white tiles are preferred.

### Dice

For Japanese mahjong you will need only two, most sets come with three or four.

### Wind marker

In Japanese sets, the wind marker is a flat rectangular piece of plastic with 東 on one side and 南 on the other. The size and colour don't matter.

### Scoring sticks

Usually a set would have at least
- four 10000-point sticks
- eight 5000-point sticks
- 36 1000-point sticks
- 40 100-point sticks (or at least 20 100-point sticks and 4 500-point sticks)
(see the tiles cheat sheet).

The sticks are usually white or off-white, some more expensive sets have sticks with different colours for each value.

Some sets come with green 500-point sticks, which are very handy. Note that in some sets of coloured sticks green is used for 100-point sticks instead, so check how many different colours there are.

It is also possible to buy sets of scoring sticks separately.

### Rules

Most likely in Japanese anyway, but they almost always contain the scoring tables, which can be useful. You can still print out a cheat sheet, so you don't need the rules

### Other equipment (used only in home rules)

The most common additional items are yakitori markers (4 flat rectangular pieces of plastic, usually orange, with a roasted chicken on one side), and chips. Most likely you'll never need these.

### Amos Compass

This is a relatively new gadget introduced by Amos. Not necessary at all. Included in the 28mm sets from Amos.

## Mats

Mats are not necessary, but once you get used to them you won't want to play without one. They reduce the noise the tiles make against the surface of the table, and have a raised edge for aligning tiles.

The Amos Junk Mat is pretty much a standard - it's good and it has holders for scoring sticks, which are very convenient. There are many other mats available.

## Non-Japanese mahjong sets

The non-Japanese mahjong sets usually have
- bigger (and heavier) tiles - most likely too big to fit on a Japanese mat
- there are no scoring sticks for Japanese mahjong
- a different wind marker - usually a 6-sided dice with a round plastic holder
- the white dragon has a rectangular frame
- there are no red fives (not used in the EMA or WRC rules, but quite commonly used in Japanese mahjong in general)
- flower tiles (not used at all in Japanese mahjong)

They also may come with
- joker tiles
- racks to hold the tiles (common in American sets) - most players seem to have an allergic reaction to them in Japanese mahjong tournaments in Europe
- rulers to straighten the tiles - not necessary if you have a mat with a raised edge

In general, any regular mahjong set can be used to play Japanese mahjong (as long as you don't need red fives), but other versions of mahjong may require additional tiles that are not found in Japanese sets.

## Where to buy

The official Amos store: https://shop.taiyo-chemicals.co.jp/

In Japan you can find mahjong sets in large department stores (like Don Quijote / ドン・キホーテ) or game stores. (Note: if you see signs with 麻雀 and/or mahjong tiles, it's most likely a mahjong parlour, not a store.)
