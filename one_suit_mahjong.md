# One suit mahjong - mini-game for 2 players

## Preparation

Take all 36 tiles of a single suit - ideally
characters, to practise recognising them,
but any suit will work.

Choose the hand size
and the corresponding difficulty level:

- 4 tiles (1 set of three and a pair) - easy,

- 7 tiles (2 set of three and a pair) - medium
(recommended),

- 10 tiles (3 set of three and a pair) - hard,

- 13 tiles (4 set of three and a pair
or 7 different pairs) - very hard (even for
experienced players).

Pick a starting dealer.

## Gameplay

Shuffle the tiles and have each player draw the
chosen number of tiles. Starting with the dealer,
players alternate taking their turns until one
player declares a win or a player cannot draw a
tile because there aren't any left.

### Turn structure

0. Optionally declare a win ("ron"), if the last
tile discarded by your opponent finishes your hand.

1. Draw a tile

2. Optionally declare a "kan" if you have four
identical tiles, and there is at least one tile
left to be drawn. If you do, show all four tiles
to your opponent, turn the middle two tiles face
down, and put the set aside. Then draw another
tile. (This step can be repeated multiple times.)

3. Optionally declare a win ("tsumo"), if the tile
just drawn finishes your hand.

4. Discard a tile.

### Declaring a win

When a player declares a win, they show all their
tiles. In case of tsumo, the last drawn tile
has to be clearly separated from the rest.

Then the player lists all the tiles that would
have finished their hand, including the one
they won on.

### Verifying a win

To verify if the win is valid, go to
https://tenhou.net/2/ , and input the hand
into the search box as follows:

- digits corresponding to the numbers on tiles,
without the last discard/draw

- a letter corresponding to the suit

  - "m" for characters

  - "s" for bamboo

  - "p" for dots

- "5z"

Press OK, and you will see the hand without the
last discard/draw and with a white dragon.

Verify that you see "聴牌" above the hand, and
not "1向聴" (or anything similar with a different
number). If you don't see "聴牌", this means that
the win declaration was invalid, as no tile would
have completed that hand.

In the box below, search for the line with a
white dragon on the left, e.g.

The tiles listed in the square brackets are all
the tiles that would complete that hand. Verify
that the last discard/draw is included in that
list, otherwise the win is not valid.

Make sure that you understand how each of the
tiles on that list would complete the hand.

# No tiles left = draw
